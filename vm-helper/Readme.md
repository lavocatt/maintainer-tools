# VM Helper

From Christian's repo https://github.com/gicmo/dot-devel/tree/master/vm-helper

## Spawn VMs

Handles the cloudinit parts and starts the VM using qemu.

## Configuration

No special configuration is needed compared to the original one.
But if you already do have a `~/.config/vmci` folder with the files `user-data` and `meta-data` configured the tool will take them.

You can force the overriding the values from you conf with the
`--override-user-data` option.

If no configuration is given, the tool will use by default the ssh key named
`id_rsa.pub` in your `~/.ssh` folder. You can specify another key to use with
the option `--ssh-key`.

The username and password configured by cloudinit are by default set to your
current username value for both your password and the username on the machine.
Root password is also set to your username.

You can change the default behavior with `--username` to set any username. And
`--password` to set a password that will be used for the user and the root
account.

# Generation

Comes along a new tool, "./gen" which is meant for requesting fresh images from
image-builder. To use it you need to have access to a valid offline token:
https://access.redhat.com/management/api

## options

### token

* `--offline-token` provide the offline token on the command line, this is to be
  avoided, because you'll leak your token in your bashrc.
* `--offline-token-command` is a command to invoke in order to retrieve the
  token. On my laptop it's set to `pass offline_token`. https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass
  is a nice tool, and I advice you find something that has an equivalent
  behavior, which is to return the token when prompted without any other values.

### image

* `--distribution` the distribution you want
* `--architecture` same for the architecture
* `--packages` a list of packages, like 'git-all' or 'vim-common'

### cache

The tool allow you to spawn a one time only disposable VM (default behavior) or
to keep your builds in the cache to use them later (more economical approach).

To use the cache, use the `--keep` option to make sure your image will get
stored under a `.cache` folder.
To reuse a previously built image, use the `--from-cache` option. Then the tool
will load it if found. If not, it'll trigger a built.

Be aware that if you trigger a build with `from-cache` it'll be saved in the
cache only if you set `--keep`â€¦ (Sorry for that!)

Objects in the cache are named `$name_$distribution_$architecture.qcow2`

### vm args

* you can specify any number of args for the `./vm` executable with `--vm-args`.
  You just have to put them in quotes.

# Example

`./gen --name img_thomas --distribution rhel-90 --architecture x86_64 --packages git-all vim-common --offline-token-command "pass offline_token" --vm-args "--memory 1024"`

This will spawn a disposable image.
You can the log onto it with `ssh localhost -p2222`
